## Quiz on Key Milestones in Software Engineering Evolution

### **What was the significance of the NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968?**
**Answer:**
It addressed the "Software Crisis" and led to structured methodologies like the Waterfall model.

### **How did Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) impact software development?**
**Answer:**
OOP, introduced in the 1980s-1990s with languages like C++, Java, and Python, improved software modularity and reusability.

### **What was the Agile Manifesto, and why was it significant?**
**Answer:**
Introduced in 2001, the Agile Manifesto emphasized iterative development, adaptability, and customer collaboration, revolutionizing software development.

## Quiz on Waterfall vs. Agile Methodologies

### **How does the Waterfall methodology differ from Agile?**
| Feature       | Waterfall | Agile |
|--------------|----------|-------|
| **Approach** | Sequential | Iterative & Incremental |
| **Flexibility** | Low (fixed early requirements) | High (adaptive to change) |
| **Testing** | Happens after development | Continuous testing |
| **Delivery** | One-time release | Frequent small releases |
| **Best for** | Large, well-defined projects | Evolving projects with rapid iterations |

### **When should Waterfall be used instead of Agile?**
**Answer:**
Waterfall is best for government software, banking systems, and medical device software, where strict regulations require well-documented, predictable processes.

## Quiz on Software Engineering Roles

### **What are the responsibilities of a Software Developer?**
**Answer:**
- Writes, tests, and debugs code.
- Collaborates with designers and testers.
- Optimizes application performance.

### **What does a Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer do?**
**Answer:**
- Designs and executes test cases.
- Ensures software meets functional and non-functional requirements.
- Identifies and reports bugs.

### **What is the role of a Project Manager (PM) in software development?**
**Answer:**
- Defines project scope and timeline.
- Coordinates team efforts.
- Manages risks and stakeholder expectations.

# Quiz on AI and Prompt Engineering

### **What is Prompt Engineering?**
**Answer:**
Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting effective prompts to interact with AI models in order to achieve desired responses.

### **Why is prompt engineering important?**
**Answer:**
1. Enhances AI accuracy by improving response quality.
2. Optimizes AI performance by reducing irrelevant outputs.
3. Improves user experience with intuitive interactions.
4. Supports customization by tailoring AI responses.

### **What is an example of a vague prompt and its improved version?**
**Vague Prompt:**
> "Tell me about AI."

**Improved Prompt:**
> "Explain what Artificial Intelligence is, including its key applications in healthcare, finance, and automation. Provide real-world examples."

### **Why is the improved prompt better?**
**Answer:**
- **Specificity**: Focuses on AI applications in particular domains.
- **Clarity**: Clearly states what information is expected.
- **Conciseness**: Avoids ambiguity and generalization.

---

## Conclusion
Software engineering and AI-driven development are evolving rapidly. Mastering SDLC, methodologies like Agile, and tools like IDEs and VCS is essential for creating robust software. Additionally, effective prompt engineering improves AI interactions, making systems smarter and more useful.
